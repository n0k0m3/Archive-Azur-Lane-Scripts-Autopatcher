# Azur Lane Scripts Autopatcher
Forked from k0np4ku's source repo

From k0np4ku:\
Archive repository of the old Autopatcher:

**v2.x.x** contains the source code of old autopatcher (2018)\
**v3.x.x** contains the source code of an autopatcher which I've never fully publish to github (2019)

From n0k0m3:

**v2.x.x** Just for archive, I will not update this in the future\
**v3.x.x** Currently being maintained and active
